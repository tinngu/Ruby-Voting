So which folder are we sticking with by the way?

Deleted the old folder, kept the new. Gonna upload the PeerRating zip file now.

Sounds good

So for testing purposes, can you download the zip you uploaded, clear the cookies
in a browser you don't often use and open up the app.rb file and test the different
functions.

Well IDK what happened, but the whole thing is completely f'd up. Upload csv/zip and nonthing happens.

Same clearing the cookies is really important, because somethings remain that still allow
the application to run even after editing.

Well erase the admin and student from the csv, pretty sure thats why there was error.
I'm getting error with zip file that says bootstrapWebsites.zip not found.

I am getting that same exact error for uploading website zip. 
Also to ensure any common userlist.csv file can be uploaded 
we can start the admin login with an obscure name. So that way any file uploaded
will not contains duplicates and prevent upload. 

username :AsqQhd9LDnwz password: password

Well, obviously you have to copy the zip file from the request to the server.... in the code that I guess you removed.

So sorry the one I was working was fine, and I didn't upload it after the zip file finally started
working, and I assumed it was the same. 

It's aight. New problem now... it won't extract.

I'm exactly where you're at now.
It says it extracts, but just goes to a blank page.

What is actually working for me now though is your inital code without rubyzip gem.
I am gonna see Ventura tomorrow, clearly the function goes through without any errors,
but it doesn't actually extract anything.

Got it working with this:

#Used for extracting zip files
#Source: http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2008/10/02/ruby-unzipping-a-file-using-rubyzip/
def unzip_file (file, destination)
  Zip::File.open(file) do |zip_file|
    zip_file.each do |f|
      f_path = File.join(destination, f.name)
      FileUtils.mkdir_p(File.dirname(f_path))
      f.extract(f_path)
    end
  end
end

Replace the other function with this
Put destination = './public/files/'  the dot is important

ADJKAGSDKAGHSDKJGHSAKHDGHJGDKGSA I glossed over that in stackoverflow, the dot is important
the dot is important.

OH MY GOD IT WAS A DOT HOLDING ME BACK FROM TEARS. Truly a break through in computer science Nam.

Heh, upload the updated code when you're done and I'll add some error checking.

Removed Admin and Student the csv file, so uploading should be good for the first time.

Hmmm have you posted # Source: http://stackoverflow.com/a/15511438
like that before? Do they even check?

I can now say that the code is good to go and running properly on my end.
Userlist upload works
website zips upload works
voting once works
sessions works

Yeah, I put sources, just in case.

Uploaded in canvas and everything works flawlessly without a fail. Final Project is officially done!

On to the final take home.

Nam just want to double check with you if the zip I uploaded looks good, he extended it till Monday,
but I think it works fine and checks all marks.

I just added some error checking, it should be all good.
Just need to rezip everything up and resubmit again.
