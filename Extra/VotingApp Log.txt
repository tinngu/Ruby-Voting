it works

alright just wanna let you know I am kinda busy with OS and my presentation, but after today I'm definitely gonna get cracking on the prpject. 11/22

***11/23/2016***
Bootstrap w/ Sinatra working

Working on it right now! So files will be updated!

So we have a log in page, good progress, still plenty of time!


12:54 pm Tin
This is a good place to write down our thoughts.
SQL Table should have the following:
Username, first pick, Second Pick, Third Pick
Also we need to have some sort of flag to prevent voting more than once.

Nam
Database up
Salt/Hashed passwords up
Login system works
Login has sessions
2 users right now:
	user: admin pw: admin
	user: student pw: student
Logout button clears session
END

10:36 PM TIN,
WOAH lotsa progress, nice work Nam.
You're really ahead of the game. I was looking at saltnig
and hashing too and saw bcrypt.

Small problem, I'd like to work on the code, but it says I am missing
bcrypt, even after I have done in cmd "gem install bcrypt"
If you have any tips or suggestins that would be helpful thanks!
END

***11/25/2016***
Nam
Yeah I had that problem too. I used this solution here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29293321/ruby-on-windows-causes-error-cannot-load-such-file-bcrypt-ext/33593911#33593911
Be sure to uninstall the bcrypt gems before following those instructions.
Also be sure to have /devkit/bin and /devkit/mingw/bin are on your PATH to run those commands.
END

3:43 PM Tin (just now saw this)
Thanks!, it works for me now! 4:18 PM
Being with family is so distracting.
I am trying to work on this now, but their chatter and
interrogation are beyond me.
Saturday I will pour my heart into this.

Alrighty so here are somethings I am just jotting down.
We want to do something like EDIT SONG for a particular username.
So each sessions voting updates their personal choices for first,second and third.
admin/:username/vote
student/:username/vote
END

12:48 PM Tin
Awwwhh shoot my brain is melting thinking about this.
I am gonna ask quite a few questions in Piazza
Should students and the TA and professor already have PRE-made usernames and passwords.

Also say for each session, a user should simply be able to pick their three choices and be done.
However on our end we want to make it so that the user ONLY updates their user and votes for that session.
END

I have no idea how to get this syntax for erb(html):
form method="post" action="/#{@votes.username}/votes"

slim seems to work with the #{@ more specifically, so I guess I'll just roll with it for now.

4:19 PM
My brain is currently melting I apologize,
current problems for me are:
DataObjects::ConnectionError at /login
unable to open database file

Nam
I can access /login alright, but when admin, I can't access the admin page.

Tin
I can view the login page fine, but after entering in or Sumbit admin,password, it gives me the error:
"unable to open database file"

Nam
I'm not getting that error, so not sure whats happening.

Tin
Ahhh, okay just to double check the username: admin and password: password
You are able to log in just fine? hmm

Nam
User: admin Password: admin ; for some reason the session isn't working though

Tin
This is silly, but I have been pulling my hair over this for the past few hours
and the reason it works for you is because you started the database and
its under user User name ex: C:/Users/Nam.../FinalProject, so when you open it, it's totally fine
The fix for me temproraily is to just copy our entire folder and paste it onto desktop
and it works fine.

But yeah you're right sessioning isn't working for me either. Log in is fine for now as long as I paste it.

Nam
I believed I fixed it by making this correction:
session[:role] == 'Admin'
I'll be gone for a couple hours, but I'll come back to work on uploading list of users and putting them in the database.

Tin
I'm not exactly sure, if we should have list of pre-set users readers with passwords, or allow people to make accounts
To save you some time I uploaded the users to the database without passwords and labeled them accordingly.

Nam
Well I had to nuke the database to expand password_hash to 100 length. If you could fix the database not saving the entry
like how the professor did it with songs, that would be good. Problem is in POST '/uploadUser'
Also, it is only hardcoded to look at customer.csv for now.

Tin 1:22 PM
I have been working on this for quiet a while now and I have such a headache from googling and reading.
What the professor is doing is CREATING songs and then editing the SPECIFIC song
what we want is when a user logs into their particular session they should only have to worry about voting,
so we should make it so that when Nam Mai logs in and clicks vote, Nam Mai is only inputting 
to the specific username "Nam Mai"s first_pick, second_pick, and third_pick.

I have work tomorrow from 12to5 :(, but I will definitely work on it afterwards and throughout the remaining week. Also gonna see Ventura during office hours Monday.


***11/27/2016***
Nam
User upload works now. To test, use userList.csv and remove the entries from the database.

Tin
On a work computer, do I have to install a csv gem for this to work?

Nam
More than likely you probably have to.

Tin
Hey Nam, I'm trying my best to keep up to speed, I really want to help,
but it currently says I am missing gems, which I assume are csv, but when
I try to install it, it says that it cannot be found. Please help.

Nam
Can you check if you can run the application?

Tin
FAST RESPONSE time! I can run the application just fine, I am trying to enter
in the CSV file.

Nam
Yeah, I got the same error as you, but everything works for me.

Tin 
Okay so after loging in with usr:admin pass: admin. I go to Choose User File...
and select the CSV that you uploaded and go onto submit, but I am getting an error.

Nam
Be sure to remove duplicate entries in the database, if thats the error.

Tin
You're a sly fox Nam! Lol it worked, it simply just uploads the results into the database?
So the CSV I uploaded shows in the database with hashed passwords.

Nam
Yep, don't think we have to worry about handling errors, just assume we get correct inputs.
We still have to sanitize the inputs into the database though.

Tin
I am having the darnest time trying to allow a user to input values into firstPick, secondPick, thirdPick
and save it. I am currently working on it with student. Baby progress made.

***11/28/2016***

Tin 1:44 PM
Adult progress made, voting works and properly saves to the database.
Also access is only granted to the specific user vote if the username matches the login
I have updated the userlist with all student names, and all passwords set to 123456 except
admin/admin and student/student for testing purposes.

The additions are added to vote.rb to save from too much clutter in app.rb, and also using slim files,
because some of the functions for accessing and displaying are shorter, and I don't know how to do it
in erb.

UGHGHGH Houston we have a problem, it's a small one.
But everytime for bundle install it says:
"
Fetching gem metadata from http://rubygems.org/.........
Fetching version metadata from http://rubygems.org/..
Could not find gem 'csv x86-mingw32' in any of the gem sources listed in your
Gemfile or available on this machine.
"

Before everything worked fine and dandy, I'm not exactly sure how I made it work in the beginning,
but it's no longer working now. For now I cannot work on the app until this is resolved, because it
is preventing me from even running it.

In addition, I have tried "gem install csv", but get the error:
C:\WINDOWS\system32>gem install csv
ERROR:  Could not find a valid gem 'csv' (>= 0) in any repository

Temporary fix for me is removing gem 'csv', and everything works fine and dandy!

Update: Users can only vote once now, so once they CAST there vote the results are 
set and they cannot change them. The user can however see who they voted for.

Also this update log is getting very long, so lets just keep this in the dropbox, for history I guess
and I'm gonna start typig in Update Log2 now.

===================================
Peer Rating Web App Guidelines

Recall an earlier assignment has extra credit for the best submissions.  You will build a web site that will allow for students to view and rate (first, second, and third) of the various student submitted web sites.
� Your web app, must store usernames and passwords in an SQL database.
� The passwords must be salted and hashed.
� There needs to be at least 2 roles - one for students allowing them to vote, and one for instructors/tas.
� There must be a way to upload a list (CSV) of users, their passwords, and roles.
� Your web app should allow each student to vote once and only once.
� The instructor/ta is able to upload as a large zip file the websites for the students.
� They instructor/ta is able to view a report of the voting.  The report should clearly indicate who voted and how they voted.
� The instructor/ta should be able to download the voting report as a CSV file.
� All input from the client needs to be sanitized and validated on the server. NOTE: you are not required to sanitize and validate the data coming from the database.
� For the voting, the order of the websites should be randomized when displayed for students.
� You will need to use sessions to ensure that users log in.
� You are also required to have an option for logging out.
� You are required to use Bootstrap for styling your web app.
� Notice I am not requiring you to use a particular language for your server side code.  Since we have covered it the most, Ruby + Sinatra is recommended.  However, you may choose any programming language/framework that you wish.  Note, however, that if you have a group with 4 members you must meet one of the language/framework requirements specified earlier.

What to submit
Zip your project and submit the zip file as an attachment.
Include a readme.md file in it that details how to run your project
-- if it is not Ruby and Sinatra, or a Clojure project from IntelliJ.
If your chosen language/framework does not create the database, make sure to include an SQL file to create the database together with instructions in the readme.md file.
