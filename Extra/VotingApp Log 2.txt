Adult progress made, voting works and properly saves to the database.
Also access is only granted to the specific user vote if the username matches the login
I have updated the userlist with all student names, and all passwords set to 123456 except
admin/admin and student/student for testing purposes.

The additions are added to vote.rb to save from too much clutter in app.rb, and also using slim files,
because some of the functions for accessing and displaying are shorter, and I don't know how to do it
in erb.

UGHGHGH Houston we have a problem, it's a small one.
But everytime for bundle install it says:
"
Fetching gem metadata from http://rubygems.org/.........
Fetching version metadata from http://rubygems.org/..
Could not find gem 'csv x86-mingw32' in any of the gem sources listed in your
Gemfile or available on this machine.
"

Before everything worked fine and dandy, I'm not exactly sure how I made it work in the beginning,
but it's no longer working now. For now I cannot work on the app until this is resolved, because it
is preventing me from even running it.

In addition, I have tried "gem install csv", but get the error:
C:\WINDOWS\system32>gem install csv
ERROR:  Could not find a valid gem 'csv' (>= 0) in any repository

Temporary fix for me is removing gem 'csv', and everything works fine and dandy!

Update: Users can only vote once now, so once they CAST there vote the results are 
set and they cannot change them. The user can however see who they voted for.

Tin 11:43 PM
Allowed for case insensitivity with the word admin, say the professor posts ADMIN or admin in the CSV file, 
it should be able to correctly detect it.

Tin 3:59 PM
I did error checking for file uploads, so if he attempts to hit submit without
anything or enters in an incorrect file the rescue statement will simply puts ERROR! to be read.

Lots of progress made, we only need one last thing and that's taking in a zip file
of websites and randomizing them. 

Nam Mai
Nice work!

Tin 10:20 AM 
Student page should [WIP] contain the list of websites randomized,
when a student logs in they are redirected to the student page with websites.
Clicking on the vote button directs them to their specific session to vote.

Tin 11:35 AM 
Files have been cleaned up and converted to .erb
I am having a really hard time figuring out how to upload a zip of websites
and then randomize it.

Nam
Uploading zip files and unzipping them works. Example zip file is bootstrapWebsites.zip and they are extracted to the
file directory.
Also made the csv downloadable and not just sent to the server files.

Made dataview of csv into table.

Displaying websites is done. Only problem is if there are spaces in the folder name and not error checking, but not going to worry about that.

Tin
For some reason Entry1 just doesn't want to display.

Ah, that folders empty. Remove the two entry folders, upload the zip, and view the websites.

For some reason after uploading the zip, the files are not extracted and I get an error
because the folder does not exist.

No errors for me. Delete everything from files directory and try using new zip file I uploaded.

Okay okay for the readme, it should be explained that the folder public and public/files and
public/bootstrap are used to contain the files and to not delete them.

Hmm for some reason I am just getting blanks. Oops accidentally saved didn't get to see your
message.

Question what folders should be kept? Does it matter if they are in the directory, when
I upload the zip and submit nothing happens on my end.

Everything should be kept. The public/files directory should be empty, and when you submit it should unzip
the files there. 

Can you update in the README file that, also what about the bootstrap folder?

UGHGHGH Nothing is being extracted when I hit submit on the zip.
For testing purposes can you copy the folder onto a desktop, open up a browser
you don't often use clear the cookies and then try to run the program.

I added error checking to both the website view and uploading, but I am still unable
to upload a zip and submit, after I go to view websites the page is completely blank.
When I check the folders after submitting the zip file, they are completely empty.

Nam
I don't know what's happening on your end, but it's working for me.
I'm using a shell command to unzip the file in ruby.

Any gems or authorities required for this?
As in running the program as an admimistrator. When I submit a zip no errors occur, but no extraction happens either.

The public/files just stays empty. However the zip submitted is put into the same directory.

Open up your cmd, and see if you can run unzip command.

Could you paste an example command of it, with a zip in the same directory. 

unzip bootstrapWebsite.zip -d ./tempFolder

If it helps my Windows 10 computer hates me, gimme a second on I'm on it.

Ahhh of course Nam, always up to date with the latest and greatest technologies.
'unzip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

When I spoke to Ventura he said the web application should be usable by him or Sreeja when 
they run it.

Well, the rubyZip gem is a PITA...

Hold up, hold up I think we can avoid it, if you explain what is needed to use the cmd unzip,
that way in the README it is clarified and they'll understand if it doesn't work, but can
work around it.

Download unzip at http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/unzip.htm
Add C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin to System Variable Path
See if you can get it working with this

So I installed unzip-5.51-1.exe and added it to the System Variable path exactly as you said,
but am still getting:
'unzip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

I'm surprised your computer does this natively, it still doesn't work for me.

Go to Edit System Variables that brings up admin prompt => Environment Variables => 
Look at System Variables at bottom and edit Path there; also add it to User Variables 
If this doesn't work, guess we'll have to use the gem

So I added it to the Path there;, but don't see User Variables.

Uploading an image that shows the user variables at top. You might have to do that for your local user as well.

Not to burst your bubble, but do you think the professor or TA will be able to do this? 
And then be able to unzip, after installing the program and adding to path and all of that.

Well if you can't, we'll just resort to the gem.
I'v already tried the gem way, but couldn't get it to work.

Yeah I know, I actually tried it too myself, but it is kind of a headache to work with.
Other than that though it looks like we've checked everything off the list.

IDK whats the problem man, got it working on another machine. 
Go here instead: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html and go to the unzip setup.
Edit variables for your account and add the /gnuwin32/bin to the path

I'm gonna try again with the rubyzip, the command is just not working for me at all.

It doesn't work exactly, but I think that the error is solvable.

Well looks like it works, just put this in the gemfile: gem 'rubyzip',  "~> 1.1", require: 'zip'


OMG does it really work!? :^)????

OMFG IT FINALLY WORKED AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE TAKE HOME IS DUE NEXT FRIDAY.
Whhheewhewhew honestly I was kinda worried so I rushed to work on it since it was monday.

Windows 10 anniversary update donked up my computer we good. 
I'm pretty sure you can zip up the file
and upload it, looks good to go for me.
===================================
Peer Rating Web App Guidelines

Recall an earlier assignment has extra credit for the best submissions.  You will build a web site that will allow for students to view and rate (first, second, and third) of the various student submitted web sites.
[X] Your web app, must store usernames and passwords in an SQL database.
[X] The passwords must be salted and hashed.
[X] There needs to be at least 2 roles - one for students allowing them to vote, and one for instructors/tas.
[X] There must be a way to upload a list (CSV) of users, their passwords, and roles.
[X] Your web app should allow each student to vote once and only once.
[X] The instructor/ta is able to upload as a large zip file the websites for the students. (I/FRAME? Dynamically host all of the websites)??? 
[X] They instructor/ta is able to view a report of the voting.  The report should clearly indicate who voted and how they voted.
[X] The instructor/ta should be able to download the voting report as a CSV file.
[X] All input from the client needs to be sanitized and validated on the server. NOTE: you are not required to sanitize and validate the data coming from the database.
[X] For the voting, the order of the websites should be randomized when displayed for students.
[X] You will need to use sessions to ensure that users log in.
[X] You are also required to have an option for logging out.
[X] You are required to use Bootstrap for styling your web app.
[X] Notice I am not requiring you to use a particular language for your server side code.  Since we have covered it the most, Ruby + Sinatra is recommended.  However, you may choose any programming language/framework that you wish.  Note, however, that if you have a group with 4 members you must meet one of the language/framework requirements specified earlier.

What to submit
Zip your project and submit the zip file as an attachment.
Include a readme.md file in it that details how to run your project
-- if it is not Ruby and Sinatra, or a Clojure project from IntelliJ.
If your chosen language/framework does not create the database, 
make sure to include an SQL file to create the database together with instructions in the readme.md file.
